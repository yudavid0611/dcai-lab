    "\n",
    "This lab highlights data-centric AI techniques (using [confident learning](https://jair.org/index.php/jair/article/view/12125)) to improve the accuracy of an XGBoost classifier on a noisy dataset that has label errors.\n",

    "The DCAI techniques demonstrated in this lab involve optimizing the dataset itself rather than altering the model's architecture or hyperparameters. As a result, it is possible to achieve further improvements in accuracy by fine-tuning the model in conjunction with the newly enhanced data, but that is not the focus of this lab.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we will:\n",

    "- Establish a baseline [XGBoost](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/) model accuracy on the original data\n",
    "- Automatically find mislabeled data points by:\n",
    "    - Computing out-of-sample predicted probabilities\n",
    "    - Estimating the number of label errors using confident learning\n",
    "    - Ranking errors, using the number of label errors as a cutoff in identifying issues\n",
    "- Remove the bad data\n",
    "- Retrain the exact same XGBoost model to see the improvement in test accuracy"

    "In this dataset, 20% of the grade labels are actually incorrect (the `noisy_letter_grade` column). Synthetic noise was added to this dataset for the purpose of this lab. In this lab, we have access to the true letter grade each student should have received (the `letter_grade` column), which we use for evaluating both the underlying accuracy of model predictions and how well our approach detects which data are mislabeled. We are careful to only use these true grades for evaluation, not for model training.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the real world, you don't have access to the true labels (you only observe the `noisy_letter_grade`, not the true `letter_grade`). So when evaluating models in the real world, you have to be careful to make sure that your test set is free of error (using methods like those covered in this lab, ideally combined with human review)."

    "_Advanced topic_: you might notice that the above `cl_issue_idx` differs in length (by a little bit) from our `issue_idx`. The reason for this is that we implemented a slightly simplified version of the algorithm in this lab. We skipped a calibration step after computing the confident joint that makes the confident joint have the true noisy prior $p(labels)$ (summed over columns for each row) and also add up to the total number of examples. If you're interested in the details of this, see equation 3 and the subsequent explanation in the [paper](https://jair.org/index.php/jair/article/view/12125)."
